## Overview

The Flight Prediction App is a web application built to predict flight ticket prices based on various input parameters such as departure time, arrival time, airline, source, and destination. This application uses a machine learning model, specifically the CatBoost Regressor, to make accurate predictions about the ticket prices. The app is built with Flask, a micro web framework in Python, making it easy to use and deploy.

## Features

* Predicts flight ticket prices with high accuracy.

* User-friendly web interface for inputting flight details.

* Support for multiple airlines, source, and destination options.


## Code Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

* Model Training: The machine learning model is trained using a dataset. The model is saved using the Pickle library so that it can be used for predictions.

* Web Application: The Flask web application provides a user interface to input flight details and get price predictions using the trained model.

## Main Libraries Used

* Flask: Web application framework for the user interface.

* Scikit-Learn: Used for data preprocessing and model training.

* CatBoost: Used for building the regression model.

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
